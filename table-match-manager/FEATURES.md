- Visual indicators show match type requirements

### 3. Player Conflict Prevention
- Players cannot be selected multiple times in the same team
- Players in Team 1 cannot be selected for Team 2
- Currently playing players cannot join the queue
- Players already in queue cannot be selected again

### 4. Enhanced UI Validation
